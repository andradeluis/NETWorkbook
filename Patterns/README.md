# Patterns
### Command and Query Responsability Segregation (CQRS)
Separates read and update operations for a data store.

### Mediator (MediatR)
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.

### Repository
Create an abstraction layer between the data access layer and the business logic layer of an application.
	
### Unit of Work (UoW):
Group one or more operations into a single transaction or “unit of work” so that all operations either pass or fail as one unit.
